- **Instructions**
	- You will need to goto the starting point on your desired rail and ">info" yourself in game and write down your position

	- You will need to take note of the direction you are facing when you start recording. (Up, North, Right, East, Down, South, Left, West) these are the directions from 12 o'clock clockwise.

	- You will need to record a [macro] of the movements you would like this system to copy. 

	- You will need to go to my github at https://github.com/malbolger/Razor2Rail and get the program "Razor2Rail" follow the onscreen instructions. This program will spit out a rails.txt file in the base directory. 

	- You will need to copy the entire contents of this file to one of the rail files included that matches the starting point rune of this rail [Runebook_1][Book_1_Rail_1, Book_1_Rail_2, ect] where [Book_1_Rail_1] would be the first rune in the Runebook named [Runebook_1]
